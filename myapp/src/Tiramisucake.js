    description="Tiramisu cake is a luscious, Italian-inspired dessert that transforms the classic tiramisu into a layered cake. It features fluffy sponge or vanilla cake layers soaked in espresso or coffee, layered with a creamy mascarpone filling, and dusted with cocoa powder. Light yet rich, this cake blends sweet, bitter, and creamy notes for a sophisticated treat."
