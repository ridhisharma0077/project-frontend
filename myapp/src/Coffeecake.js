    description="Coffee cake is a soft, buttery cake often swirled or topped with a cinnamon-sugar streusel and sometimes filled with nuts or fruit. Despite the name, it doesn’t always contain coffee—it’s typically meant to be enjoyed with coffee as a comforting snack or breakfast treat. Some variations do include a hint of coffee flavor in the batter or glaze."
    ingredients="All-purpose flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, unsalted butter, eggs, sour cream or yogurt, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, chopped nuts (optional), powdered sugar (for glaze), brewed coffee (optional, for flavor or glaze)"
