    description="Lemon drizzle cake is a zesty, moist sponge cake infused with the bright flavor of fresh lemons. After baking, it's soaked with a tangy lemon syrup that seeps into the cake, giving it a sweet and sharp citrus kick. Often topped with a glossy lemon glaze or icing, itâ€™s a refreshing and light treat perfect for tea time."
    ingredients="All-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, granulated sugar, eggs, unsalted butter, milk or yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, powdered sugar (for glaze), vanilla extract (optional)"
